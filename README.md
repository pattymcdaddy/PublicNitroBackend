# The backend to my Nitro Booster tutorial.

Please do not resell or redestribute this in any way.


**Step one:**
- Clone this respository onto your local machine, VPS or wherever you choose to host:

 ```git clone https://github.com/ptrcko2/PublicNitroBackend```

*If you choose to host this on glitch, open the following project and "remix" it:*

```https://glitch.com/edit/#!/desert-planet-mammal```
Then open the env file and add a variable for token then run the project.

**Step two:**
- Head to the .env and insert your discord bot's token. -- If you use glitch or already set this up, just skip.

**Step three:**
- Run ```npm i``` and replace the express URL inside of the Script, at line 9.

 **Thats all to it! If you have any questions, feel free to DM me on discord or on any contact listing on DevForums.**
